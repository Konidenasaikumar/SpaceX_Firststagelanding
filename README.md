# Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This project aims to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land. The ability to accurately predict the landing outcome is crucial as it directly impacts the cost of a launch. SpaceX, known for its cost-effective operations, advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a price tag of 62 million dollars, significantly lower than other providers whose costs can go up to 165 million dollars per launch. This cost advantage is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a prediction model that can determine if the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. By accurately predicting the landing outcome, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This information will be valuable for alternate companies planning to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch, allowing them to assess the cost competitiveness of their proposals.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical data related to Falcon 9 launches. It includes various features such as launch date, mission details, technical specifications, and the landing outcome of the first stage. The dataset will be utilized to train and evaluate the prediction model.

## Methodology

The project will follow the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather relevant data related to Falcon 9 launches, including information on launch outcomes and associated factors.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, transforming categorical variables, and performing any necessary feature engineering.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to gain insights, visualize patterns, and understand the relationships between variables.
4. Model Development: Machine learning model is built to predict landing outcome of the Falcon 9 first stage. Several classification algorithms were explored and evaluated to identify the most accurate and reliable model.
5. Cost Estimation: Utilize the predicted landing outcomes to estimate the cost of a launch.

## Technologies Used

The project requires the following technologies:

- Data collection: SpaceX API
- Implementation: Python, Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn
- Server: Python server
- Frontend: HTML, Streamlit
- Please ensure that these technologies and libraries are available and properly installed in your environment.


## Conclusion

By accurately predicting the landing outcome of the Falcon 9 first stage, this project provides valuable insights into the cost of a launch. Alternate companies interested in competing with SpaceX for rocket launches can utilize this information to make informed decisions regarding pricing and bid competitiveness. The prediction model developed as part of this project contributes to the advancement of cost-effective space exploration and supports cost estimation in the commercial space industry.
